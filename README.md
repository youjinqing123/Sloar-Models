# Sloar-Models
Solar modules are composed of many solar cells. The solar cells are subject degradation, caus ing many different types of defects. Defects may occur during transportation or installation of modules as well as during operation, for example due to wind, snow load or hail. Many of the defect types can be found by visual inspection. A common approach is to take electrolu minescense images of the modules. To this end, a current is applied to the module, causing the silicon layer to emit light in the near infrared spectrum. This light is then captured by specialized cameras.Different kinds of cracks. The size of cracks may range from very small cracks (a few pixels in our case) to large cracks that cover the whole cell. In most cases, the performance of the cell is unaffected by this type of defect, since connectivity of the cracked area is preserved. 2. Inactive regions are mainly caused by cracks, where a part of the cell to becomes disconnected. This disconnected area does not contribute to the power production. Hence, the cell performance is decreased.p Of course, the two defect types are related, since an inactive region is often caused by cracks. However, we treat them as independent and only classify a cell as cracked, if the cracks are visible on its own.
